### Notes on Licensing

**Why so many license changes?**

The project has always meant a lot to me, and I'm not the legal type, so I struggled to figure out how to protect it. I started with MIT, then moved to Apache 2.0, then GPLv3, and finally AGPLv3. Each time I realized they didn't quite fit the project.

With 0.3.0, I've finally struck the balance between freedom and protection:

* **MPL 2.0** covers the project's code.
* **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0** covers all other content, including logos, names, write-ups, and other artistic, literary, or branding elements.

This new approach ensures the project remains open source while ensuring protection and credibility.
