# Core Concept

A website to learn and practice identifying phishing attacks in emails.

* Designed for users with little to no prior cybersecurity knowledge.
* Educational, lesson-based format to gradually increase complexity.
* Simulates an email service UI where users identify suspicious elements.
* Lessons progressively introduce more advanced phishing tactics.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

* Display email with sender info, subject line, and body text.
* Include a brief intro about the company and the user's role.
* User classifies each email as **"Legit"** or **"Phish"**.
* Provide immediate feedback with concise explanations.
* Save user progress in local storage.
* Organize lessons into levels: Tutorial, Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced.
* Hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Potential Future Features

* Include email attachments and clickable links.
* Challenge mode with randomly generated emails and less specific feedback.
* Score tracking saved locally.
* Options to export/import progress.
* Timed challenge modes.
* Daily streaks and correct-answer streaks.
* Badge and achievement system.
* Leaderboards for competition.
* Host independently from GitHub Pages.
* Local device installation for computers and phones.
* Lessons inspired by real-world phishing attacks.

## Title Ideas

* Find the Phish
* Spot the Phish
* Catch the Phish
* Don't Take the Bait
* **Is This a Phish?**
* This Is Not a Phish
* Phish or Legit
